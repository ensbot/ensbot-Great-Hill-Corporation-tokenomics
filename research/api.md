## videos
- [Hypermedia APIs - John Moore](https://vimeo.com/20781278) -- talks about Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS) and why many APIs aren't adhering to Uniform interface constraint of Fielding's spec. Particularly, independent evolution and decoupled implementation. He then goes into his api with XHTML media type. This video is from 2010 and I noticed some things that seem outdated. Other resources may be better.
