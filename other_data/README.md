#### Other Data

We can use this to collect together some data I've gathered over the last few months:

1. [Contracts.csv](./Contracts.csv) - A list of all Ethereum contracts as of block 4,750,000 along with how many other contracts that contract deployed sorted by number of sub-contracts.

2. [tokensByWeek.txt](./tokensByWeek.txt) - Token related transactions by week since inception

3. [Transactions.xlsx](./Transactions.xlsx) - Transactions per 50,000 blocks by nTraces to block 5,000,000

4. [Traces.xlsx](./Traces.xlsx) - Traces per 50,000 blocks by nTraces to block 5,000,000
